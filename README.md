# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
Using third party APIs I've created a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for different cities using the API provided by openweather. 



How this works:

When you search for a city you are then presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. It will display current temp, wind speed, humidity levels, and UV index levels. It will also display a 5 day forecast for the current city you are looking up.Everything is saved so that when I close and reopen dashboard my search history is still there.



A web browser such as Google Ch!rome, Internet Explorer, Safari or Firefox is needed to run the application.

The application can be accessed via the following link:https://kevinserrano.github.io/MyWeatherDashboard/
